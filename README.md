**Player** is drawn as '0' and **ghosts** are drawn as 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'.

Enter **arrows**(↑ ↓ → ←) to move the player.

The objective of the game is gathering all **dots**(.) in the map.

When the player is overlapped by a ghost, they lose the game.

When the player gathers all dots they win. (the left dots are visible on the bottom)
